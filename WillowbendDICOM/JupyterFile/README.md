A dialog-based DICOM to video converter.

**DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine)** is a standard for handling, storing, printing, and transmitting information in medical imaging. DICOM files can be exchanged between two entities that are capable of receiving image and patient data in DICOM format by following network communications protocol. DICOM has been widely adopted by hospitals and is making inroads in smaller applications like dentists' and doctors' offices.

This project is to implement the process of conversion from DICOM format to video format (avi) in order to meet the needs and requirements for universal computer systems (PC, Mac, Linux, etc.). So the ordinary users of such systems can use the converted file to present, communicate and store the universal files. Case reports in medical conferences, educations of clinical medicine will become more convenient to use universal video formats in the slide presentations.
